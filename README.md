# net.zero
Immutable disclosure of Sustanability Development Goals: Green House Gases  : Chainlink Hackathon fall 2021

## Inspiration

### What is net zero?
Put simply, net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. We reach net zero when the amount we add is no more than the amount taken away.

Currently net zero mechanism depends has a central dependency on analytics firms facilitating collection and processing of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data. In most scenarios data is consolidated using a questionnaire may fail to capture mandatory disclosures. This single point of dependency can lead to bias, innacurate reporting and green washing. Institutions and Individuals may invest direct capital or invest in oranisations that may be unknowingly polluting or supporting unsustainable practices. It is of utmost improtance that investors have access to tranparent information to make an informed decision to support green economy**. It is imperative that organisations have access to accturate information to engage in sustainable practices or corrective actions.
This in turn can lead to instutional and non institutional investors to direct capital in to unsustainable econony

We believe there is an opportunity for us to decentralise, mitigate single points of failure, bias and dependency on centralised players. Technology can provide systemic evidence to monitor, control and mitigate greenhouse gasses. 

### The Vision : 
We rise to the challenge of building a moral, decentralised and data centric green economy. 

### The mission:
To build a path to net zero. A mechanism for corrective action that sets us on path to Green economy. 

## Objective:

Provide unbiased disclosure  to public/investors/ institutions.

Provide an immutable trail of evidence on pollution triggers.

Use the data to drive a net.zero mechanism. United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13, Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*

The challenged is to do this in the most cost efficient, decentralised and impactful way(UX). 


**A green economy is an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment.
